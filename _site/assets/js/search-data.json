    "content": "The Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA) tool is an essential part of the PhosphoNetVis platform, allowing users to analyze their phosphoproteomic datasets and identify potential kinase targets. This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process of running a KEA analysis on your own data, starting from the download of the necessary file to the creation of a Kinase-Substrate Interaction (KSI) network. No prior knowledge of the KEA tool is required, as we will provide all the necessary information to successfully complete the tutorial. Let’s get started! . Step #1 . Download the dataset file for analysis: The first step is to download a dataset that is in the correct format file for analysis. You can use the example file provided by clicking on the “Download Sample Data” link below. ⬇️ Download Sample Data . Step #2 . Data Format &amp; Parameters: Before running the analysis, take a look at the required data format and customizable parameters listed on the KEA page. If you hover over each parameter, a tooltip will appear that describes its function. For this tutorial, we won’t be changing any of the parameters. Step #3 . Upload Data &amp; Run Analysis: After you have the dataset file, navigate to the “Upload Data &amp; Run Analysis” section on the KEA page. Click on the “Browse” button and select the file you downloaded in step 1. Then click on the “Run” button to start the analysis. Step #4 . Check Analysis Status: The analysis may take some time to complete depending on the size of the dataset file. You can check the status of the analysis on the same page. Once the analysis is complete, a message will appear on the page indicating that the network has been created successfully. Step #5 . Download KSI Network: Click on the “Download” button to download the KSI network file that was generated as a result of the analysis, and examine the file. This file will be used to visualize the network. Note that the visualization of this network will be shown in the next tutorial. ",

    "content": "In this tutorial, we will explore how to customize and visualize the output of Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA) using PhosNetVis. KEA is a tool that allows you to identify kinases that are likely to be responsible for the observed phosphorylation patterns in a given dataset. Once the KEA analysis is complete, you can customize the output network by adding additional columns of data. After customization, you can upload the network files to PhosNetVis for 3D visualization. PhosNetVis provides interactive features for exploring the network, such as rotating, zooming, panning, and viewing node information. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to customize and visualize the output of KEA analysis for better exploration and analysis of the network. Let’s get started! . Step #1 . Customize the network: The output file of KEA analysis, or a network file in a correct format can be customized by adding additional columns according to the guide table provided below, using a spreadsheet software or by custom scripts on R &amp; Python. The guide table will show what kind of data can be added to built or customize a network for specific needs. Important Note: In the following steps, we will be using the customized version of the network generated on Tutorial 1 - Kinase Enrichment Analysis, where edges are randomly colored by adding EdgeColor column to the network. ⬇️ Download Customized Network . Step #2 . Upload Networks for Visualization: In the next step, you will need to upload the network files for visualization. Enter the number of networks you want to visualize and select these files. After selecting them, click on the “Upload” button to start the visualization process. Step #3 . Explore the Network in 3D: Once the networks have been uploaded, they will be visualized using PhosNetVis in 3D.
