<b>2.) What is phosphorylation and why is it important?</b>
<br>
->  Phosphorylation is a process where a phosphate group is added to a protein. This tiny modification can have major effects:
·  	Turning Proteins On and Off: Phosphorylation can activate or deactivate proteins, controlling their function in cells.
·  	Cell Communication: It helps cells talk to each other by regulating signals sent between them.
·  	Cell Growth and Division: Phosphorylation is crucial for regulating cell growth, division, and other important processes.
·  	Gene Expression: It can influence which genes are turned on or off, impacting how cells behave and respond to their environment.
·  	Metabolism: Phosphorylation plays a role in how cells use energy and process nutrients.
In essence, phosphorylation is a molecular switch that helps cells respond to changes in their surroundings and carry out their functions properly.
