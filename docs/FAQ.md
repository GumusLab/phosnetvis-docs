<b>1.) Does PhosNetVis requires the users to login?</b>
<br>
No PhosNetVis does not requires you to login.
<br>
<br>
<b>2.) What are some other tools which can be used for doing Kinase-substrate enrichment analysis?
<br>
If the users have GeneId and residue Ids then <a href="https://casecpb.shinyapps.io/ksea/" target="_blank">KSEA tool</a> can be used.

<b>3.) What is phosphorylation and why is it important?</b>
<br>
Phosphorylation is a process where a phosphate group is added to a protein. This tiny modification can have major effects:<br>
·  	Turning Proteins On and Off: Phosphorylation can activate or deactivate proteins, controlling their function in cells.<br>
·  	Cell Communication: It helps cells talk to each other by regulating signals sent between them.<br>
·  	Cell Growth and Division: Phosphorylation is crucial for regulating cell growth, division, and other important processes.<br>
·  	Gene Expression: It can influence which genes are turned on or off, impacting how cells behave and respond to their environment.<br>
·  	Metabolism: Phosphorylation plays a role in how cells use energy and process nutrients.<br>
In essence, phosphorylation is a molecular switch that helps cells respond to changes in their surroundings and carry out their functions properly.

<b>4.) What is a Kinase Substrate Interaction (KSI) network?</b>
<br>
A KSI network shows how kinases (special proteins) interact with other proteins called substrates. Kinases help regulate many activities inside cells by adding a phosphate          group to substrates. These interactions are like connections in a network, where each kinase is linked to the proteins it affects. By studying this network, scientists can          understand how cells work and find new ways to treat diseases.

<b>5.) Does PhosNetVis store data on a server?</b>
<br>
PhosnetVis runs on the client browser window. All modules except fGSEA(fast gene-set enrichment algorithm) run on the local browser. For fGSEA, the data are sent to a HIPAA-compliant server at the Icahn School of Medicine, through a HTTPS protocol which is safe and secure. Once the fGSEA is run, no data is stored on the server.
