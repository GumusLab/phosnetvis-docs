# Kinase Enrichment Analysis

The Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA) tool is an essential part of the PhosphoNetVis platform, allowing users to analyze their phosphoproteomic datasets and identify potential kinase targets. This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process of running a KEA analysis on your own data, starting from the download of the necessary file to the creation of a Kinase-Substrate Interaction (KSI) network. No prior knowledge of the KEA tool is required, as we will provide all the necessary information to successfully complete the tutorial. **Let's get started!**

### Step #1
Download the dataset file for analysis: The first step is to download a dataset file for analysis. You can use the example file provided by clicking on the "Download Sample Data" button below.
